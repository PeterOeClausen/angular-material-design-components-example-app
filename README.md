# Angular Material sample application developed for a blog post

I made a blog post about Angular, Material Design and Angular Material. Link: X

In the post I explain about Angular, Material Design and Angular Material. I developed a login page using Angular Theming, I create my own dark theme, and show extra tips to the more experienced Angular Material developer.

This repository contains the source code for the sample Angular Application.
