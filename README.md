# Angular Material sample application developed for a blog post

I made a blog post about Angular, Material Design and Angular Material. Link: X

In the post I explain about Angular, Material Design and Angular Material. I developed a login page using Angular Theming, I create my own dark theme, and show extra tips to the more experienced Angular Material developer.

This repository contains the source code for the sample Angular Application.

The login page can be seen below:

To run the Angular application:
- Download or clone the repository
- `cd example-app`
- `npm install`
- `ng serve`
